House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing and where he made lots of friends and lived
happily ever after...  He definitely did not get axe murdered.

My dream Story is that Ned does not go to Kings Landing and protected Winterfel
from the white walkers.
